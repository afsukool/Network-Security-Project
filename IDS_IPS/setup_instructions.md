# IDS/IPS Setup Instructions

## Overview
This document provides step-by-step instructions for setting up and configuring an Intrusion Detection System (IDS) or Intrusion Prevention System (IPS) using Snort or Suricata.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding with the IDS/IPS setup, ensure that you have:
- Access to a Linux-based server or virtual machine.
- Basic knowledge of networking concepts and Linux command-line interface (CLI) operations.

## Steps
1. **Install IDS/IPS Software**: Install either Snort or Suricata on your Linux server using the package manager or by compiling from source.

2. **Configuration File Setup**: Copy the provided configuration file (`snort.conf` for Snort or `suricata.yaml` for Suricata) to the appropriate directory on your system.

3. **Rule Updates**: Download the latest rule sets for your chosen IDS/IPS software from the official website or community repositories.

4. **Rule Configuration**: Configure the IDS/IPS rules according to your network security requirements and threat landscape. Modify the configuration file to enable specific rule categories and customize rule parameters.

5. **Interface Configuration**: Specify the network interface(s) to monitor for network traffic and intrusion detection/prevention.

6. **Start IDS/IPS Service**: Start the IDS/IPS service using the provided command-line interface (CLI) commands or service management tools.

7. **Testing**: Test the IDS/IPS configuration by sending test traffic or triggering known intrusion attempts to verify that the system detects and responds to threats correctly.

8. **Monitoring and Maintenance**: Regularly monitor IDS/IPS alerts and logs to detect and respond to potential security incidents. Update rule sets and configuration as needed to adapt to evolving threats.

## Troubleshooting
If you encounter any issues during the IDS/IPS setup or configuration, refer to the software documentation, community forums, or online resources for troubleshooting guidance.
